in OSD and taking Final exams. Gathers data from 3 files:
<ol>

<li>accommodations</li>
</ol>

<p align="justify">The name of the file has the following structure: 
"<i>Month year</i> final exam master list.xlsx", where <i>month</i> is the last month
of the term in which exams are taken. Example: "April 2013 final exam master list.xlsx".
The program creates two sheets.</p> 

<p align="justify">The programm looks for conflicts (a student has two or more exams 
on the same day) and indicates it in the "Location" column of the second sheet.</p>

<p align="justify">When conflicts resolved, late times finalized and invigilators
registered, the second option "Assign places" allocates places and invigilators.
Info on invigilators taken from the webform results: "https://www.mcgill.ca/osd/node/884/webform-results".
This is the final stage in working with the file.</p>

<p align="justify">"List for professors" option creates a new file with a list of students for
each professor. It looks for professors' emails first in the midterm files of the same term
and then on the site "http://www.mcgill.ca/directory/staff".</p>
